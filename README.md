Task2:
B: Build pose model
– using the recorded video footage
– applying the frameworks you learned in the labs
– apply transfer learning based on existing pose
estimation models

C: Evaluate pose model. 
We will not manually label
pose estimation keypoints, as we build our
models based on already tested transfer
models. Instead plausibility checks shall be
performed checking
– The absolute values for each keypoint (outliers ?)
– The values for each keypoint over time (anomalies?)
– The values for each keypoint relative to other
keypoints (anomalies ?)

Task3:
Derive relevant metrics from pose
model
 Based on domain exploration
results and the pose data from the
videos define metrics capturing the
running pose / style
 Calculate these metrics for all
videos
